**DSA = Data Structures and Algorithms**
Think of data structures as different boxes or containers where you keep your toys.
Each box has a different rule of keeping toys:

**Array/List**→ Toys are kept in a line (like seats in a bus 🚌).

**Stack** → Toys are kept one on top of another (like a stack of plates 🍽️). You can only take from the top. (LIFO = Last In, First Out)

**Queue** → Toys are kept in a line (like a queue in school 🎒). First toy goes out first. (FIFO = First In, First Out)

**Linked List** → Toys are connected with a string 🪢. To reach the 3rd toy, you must pass through the 1st and 2nd.

**Tree** → Toys arranged like a family tree 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 (parent → child).

**Graph** → Toys connected in a network (like roads connecting cities 🛣️).

**2. Algorithm (A)**

Now, once you have toys in a box, how do you play with them?
That’s where algorithms come in — they are step-by-step instructions.

Examples of algorithms:

**Sorting** → Arrange toys from small to big 📏 (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).

**Searching** → Find your favorite toy inside the box 🔍 (Binary Search, Linear Search).

**Path Finding** → How to go from one toy to another in the fastest way (like Google Maps 🚗).**
