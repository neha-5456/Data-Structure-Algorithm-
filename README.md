**Stack Data Structure**
A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle. The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

# **Basic Operations**

**Push:** Add an element to the top of the stack

**Pop:** Remove and return the top element from the stack

**Peek/Top:** Return the top element without removing it

**isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty

**isFull**: Check if the stack is full (for fixed-size implementations)

**Size**: Return the number of elements in the 

# **Common Applications**
1. Function call management (call stack)
2. Undo/Redo functionality in applications
3. Expression evaluation and syntax parsing
4. Backtracking algorithms
5. Browser history management
